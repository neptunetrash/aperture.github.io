#### 5. Simulator Interactions:
<br>

Sr.No | What Students will do? |	What Simulator will do?	| Purpose of the task
:--|:--|:--|:--:
1.| Simulator will allow student to make experimental setup and will alert him in case of wrong setup made. | Student will choose the optical fiber slide the power button of the simulator to ON position. | To initiate the simulator
2.| Simulator will show the green light indicating that the simulator is ready for use | Student will vary the distance between the optical fiber outlet and the screen and to measure the diameter of the spot on the screen.  | To find the value of half acceptance angle of the optical fiber.
3.|  Simulator will show the corresponding diameter of the spot on the screen. |  Student will insert the diameter of the spot on the screen corresponding to each value of the distance between the optical fiber outlet and the screen and mention these values in the table. |  To get the diameter of the spot on the screen (D) values and the distance between the optical fiber outlet and the screen (L) values.
4.|  Simulator will calculate D and L values in the Table. |  Student will press the draw Graph button   | To plot graph between D and L
5.| Simulator will show plot between D and L | Student will choose any two points on the graph and press the calculate slope button | Student will note the value of the slope and calculate the Numerical aperture of the given optical fiber and will also calculate the percentage error with the standard value
6.|  Slope of the graph will be calculated. | Student will change the optical fiber and will repeat the experiment | Student will again note the value of the slope and calculate the Numerical aperture of the new optical fiber and will also calculate the percentage error with the standard value.
