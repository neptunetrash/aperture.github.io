The maximum angle within which light will be accepted into and guided through optical fiber is<br>
NA = n<sub>0</sub> Sin (α<sub>max</sub>) = (n1<sup>2</sup> – n2<sup>2</sup>)<sup>1/2</sup> = Sin (tan<sup>-1</sup>(D/2L))			<br><br>

where <br>
α<sub>max</sub> = the half acceptance angle,<br>	
n0       = the refractive index of air<br> 
n1     = the refractive index of the core<br>
n2     = the refractive index of the cladding<br> 
D     = the diameter of the spot on the screen <br>
L     = the distance between the output end of the fiber and the screen.<br><br>

 If the incident angle α < α<sub>max</sub>, the ray undergoes multiple internal reflections at core and cladding interface and it is called the guided ray. If α < α<sub>max</sub>, the ray undergoes only partial reflection at core cladding interface. In short length of straight fiber, ideally a ray launched at angle α at the input end should come out at the same angle α from output end. Therefore, the far field at the output end will also
appear as a cone of semi angle αmax emanating from the fiber end.
